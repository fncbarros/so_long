TODO:	-Remake map reading
			Maybe build map as you go;
		-Restructure main;
			More functions;
		-Error handling!!;

PSEUDO (or blueprint rather):
	read map
	check if it's valid
		valid chars 01CEP(only 1 P and 1 E)
		1st and last line needs be all 1's and all others need start and end w/ a 1
		total needs to be equal to no of lines * lenght of 1st line
		if not display err ("Error\n" followed by an explicit error message)
	mlx init
	build images
	build window (wall image line lenght (in pixels) * map width (in 1's))
		(paint window...)
	build map through array (1d/2d ??) (send every image to window)
	build keyhooks (WASD, ESC, red cross button, need free all memory in such cases)
		Actions: movement, collecting and exiting
		Requires printing images for each action

All image addresses dealt as int pointers/arrays
